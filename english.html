            MOTIVATION

        <main id = "conteudo">
            Lenine is a Brazilian artist, born in Pernambuco on February 2, 1959. What genuinely motivated me to choose him as the main focus of this project was the affection and admiration I have for his work. This feeling, however, is fully justified and is based not only on affection, but also on his remarkable technical and creative ability. Lenine has shared the stage with international artists and seeks, through his music, to expand the richness of Brazilian culture both within and beyond national borders. His work blends foreign genres with maracatu and MPB, creating a language of his own. The central themes of his compositions involve his life journey, his worldview, ecology, environmental degradation caused by human activity, and social tragedies that affect the underprivileged, without giving up hope as a transformative force. In this way, Lenine brings to the popular music scene the multiple cultural strands of the country — from the Northeast to the North and Southeast — proposing a vision of unity built from pluralism.
