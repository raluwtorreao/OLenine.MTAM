                <p> <b>EITA, 2025</b> His newest album marks the artist’s return with a vibrant work deeply connected to its time. The record reinforces the sonic identity that established Lenine, blending Northeastern rhythms, MPB, rock, and electronic experimentation, without giving up poetry and reflection. The songs engage with everyday life, addressing themes such as social transformations, astonishment in the face of the contemporary world, and creativity as a force of resistance. </p>
            </section>
            After 10 years away from production, Lenine presents his latest project EITA as a breath of relief and continuity. The album’s central theme is rooted in his cultural and personal origins, focusing on what he achieved thanks to the environment in which he was raised. In this way, alongside his newest record, Lenine also gave rise to his latest audiovisual production of the same name: “EITA!”. In it, he talks about his origins, the paths he followed in life, and his musical and intimate journey. <a href = "https://youtu.be/vzS7f3VOxyE?si=qqULA4rDseHmJDV1">EITA!</a> is now available.

                 <p> <b>Acústico MTV, 2006</b> Presents a remarkable compilation, curiously absent today from many music platforms. The album values the essential, with clean arrangements and the pure sound of the guitar, revealing nuances of the songs.

                 <p> <b>Na Pressão, 1999</b> Powerfully synthesizes what Lenine seeks in his music: rough, direct rock, sweetly immersed and tinged with maracatu. The album unites impact and delicacy, rhythm and poetry.

                 <p> <b>The Day We Will Make Contact, 1997</b> Emerges from a blend of Northeastern culture and the extraterrestrial aesthetics of science fiction. The album mixes maracatu, regional rhythms, and futuristic sounds, creating a singular universe. Between cosmic imagery and earthly references, passionate and abstract compositions arise, exploring human sentiment, its affections, fears, and desires, projecting love and existence beyond time, space, and the boundaries of reality.</p>

            <section class="EITA">
                 <p> <b>Olho de Peixe, 1993</b> Created by Lenine alongside Marcos Suzano, this album is marked by a beach-oriented and deeply Northeastern character. The songs evoke the sea, the wind, and the coastal landscape, with a strong presence of berimbau and organic percussion. The record celebrates the infinity of natural beauty, transforming sound into landscape and inviting contemplation, affection, and sensitive listening to the world and its eternal, free, and ancestral rhythms of the Brazilian coast.</p>
